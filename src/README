Automatic install in OMV:
------------------
install the autoshutdown-plugin from stable repository: http://packages.omv-plugins.org/


Automatic install in Debian/Ubuntu:
------------------
run "./install.sh" on the CLI

Manual Install:
---------------
Just copy:
autoshutdown.conf to /etc
autoshutdown.sh and libs.sh to /usr/local/bin

then setup the config-file and do a

    sudo chmod +x autoshutdown.sh

The script should run now. To start it @ boot, see http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/28

Expert Settings in autoshutdown.conf:

LOADPROCNAMES
command names of processes with load dependent children to check if they have something to do
checked by default="proftpd,smbd,nfsd,transmission-daemon,mt-daapd,forked-daapd")
					 
TEMPPROCNAMES
command names of processes only started when active
checked with "top" AND "ps", so all processes are found, even such, which doesn't show up in top
like "lftp" - Beware: If the process shows up in "ps" when there is no connection, your PC won't shutdown!
maybe you have to call the process like this: "lftp -do -something -here && exit"
checked by default="in.tftpd")

if you want other processes than the default ones, please uncomment the above lines and add your process at the end of the line
to disable the process-check, set LOADPROCNAMES="-" or TEMPPROCNAMES="-"

The following scheme is mandatory for both LOADPROCNAMES and TEMPPROCNAMES:
process1,process2
all processes separated by comma ','

NETSTATWORD
It is needed, if someone wants to test autoshutdown.sh on the CLI, because on the CLI the netstat-output is language-specific. At systemstart netstat-output is always english
for german Debian/Ubuntu = "VERBUNDEN", other languages: 'netstat -n' on the CLI and you shoud see this output:

	# Aktive Internetverbindungen (ohne Server)
	# Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
	# tcp        0      0 192.168.178.21:2049     192.168.178.23:753      VERBUNDEN  
	# tcp        0      0 192.168.178.21:22       192.168.178.23:53099    VERBUNDEN

now take the word under "State" -> "VERBUNDEN" and set it for NETSTATWORD

SHUTDOWNCOMMAND
If you don't want to shutdown your PC, but go in hibernate/suspend: Define the command here
If nothing is defined, it shuts down with "shutdown -h now"

# SHUTDOWNCOMMAND="pm-hibernate" => puts the PC in hibernate-mode
# SHUTDOWNCOMMAND="pm-suspend"  => puts the PC in suspend-mode 
# SHUTDOWNCOMMAND="shutdown -h +5"  => shuts the PC down 5 min after shutdown-command
For more information and how to set up hibernate and suspend, look here:
http://wiki.debian.org/Suspend
http://wiki.debian.org/Hibernation

FAKE
set it to "true" for a Fake-Mode: The script runs dry: You can test what happens, without shutting down your PC
This is also possible through a switch in OMV-GUI. Setting it to "false" or if it is not set, the script will run normally.
With Fake-Mode ON, the script doesn't sleep 5 minutes after it starts.

PINGLIST
With this, you can define a path to a file, which contains list of IPs that should be scanned
only one IP per line is allowed - Format: mmm.nnn.ooo.ppp
e.g.:
192.168.1.45
If this expert-setting is used, the IPs specified in "RANGE" or in GUI doesn't work

ULDLCHEC
set it to "true" for a network-traffic check in autoshutdown. Then don't forget to set ULDLRATE also!

ULDLRATE
define the network traffic in kB/s
in each cycle autoshutdown checks whether the network-traffic (upload or download) is over the set value
under this value, no shutdown
over this value, your PC shuts down

PLUGINCHECK
Set this to true, if autoshutdown.sh checks for PlugIns in /etc/autoshutdown.d
set it to "false" (or uncemmented) to skip the check

E.g.: When ClamAV does a check, the Server shouldn't shut down
How to do that?
Let's look at a example: in the clamav-plugin for autoshutdown (etc/autoshutdown.d/clamav) the following is set:

   # In which folder is the file to look for
   folder="/var/run/clamav"
   # filename (can be expanded with regexes)
   file="clamdscan-[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12}"

Then, if a file i.e.: clamdscan-aaaa3556-adfe-5678-abcdef012345 (or whatever UUID) in /var/run/clamav exists, the Server isn't shutdown

also possible:
    folder="/home/user"
    file="backup.status"
    content="processing job"

If a file /home/user/backup.status exists with the content 'processing job', the Server isn't shutdow
This is useful for backupscripts. It is not nice if the PC is shutting down while the backup-script is running. 
In my backup-script i use a simple

    echo "processing job" > /home/user/backup.status

at the beginning and a

    rm /home/user/backup.status

at the end of the script. In the boot-Phase also a

    rm /home/user/*.status

to delete all *.status files, which are not deleted before (loss of power for example)

Please have a look at the two example files in /etc/autoshutdown.d
